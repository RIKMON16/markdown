- How to apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

## _What is Markdown?_

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Gists
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with .md or .markdown extension

For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help.

## _Examples_

It's very easy to make some words `**bold**` and other words `*italic*` with Markdown. You can even `[link to Google!](http://google.com)`

### _Syntax guide_

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

#### _HEADER_

`# This is an <h1> tag`

`## This is an <h2> tag`

`###### This is an <h6> tag`

#### _EMPHASIS_

`*This text will be italic*`

`_This will also be italic_`

`**This text will be bold**`

`__This will also be bold__`

`_You **can** combine them_`

#### _LISTS_

##### _UNORDERED_

`* Item 1`

`* Item 2`

    `* Item 2a`
    `* Item 2b`

Will display as follows

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

##### _ORDERED LIST_

`1. Item 1`

`1. Item 2`

`1. Item 3`

displays as follows

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 1a
   2. Item 2a

##### _IMAGES_

`![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`

`Format: ![Alt Text](url)`

will represent pic as follows

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

##### _LINKS_

`http://github.com - automatic!`

`[GitHub](http://github.com)`

##### _BLOCKQUOTES_

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so the present is our past.

##### _INLINE CODE_

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

##### _TABLE_

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

`First Header | Second Header`

`------------ | -------------`

`Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2`

`Content in the first column | Content in the second column`

it will represent as follows

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

##### _EMOJI_

GitHub supports [emoji](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#using-emoji)
